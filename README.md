# M5-Work-Day-Planner

## Task and What I learned
- Task to create a work day planner from 9am to 5pm.
- Depending on time the calendar will show what has passed (grey), present (red), and future (green)
- This project utilizes what I learned from JQuery, moment.JS, and boostrap.
- This project I feel like will help when I am unable to access the HTMl and CSS pages and have to make changes from JS itself.
- Not sure what I did wrong to not be able to get input to save locally.
